## Running on your Machine

Once you've installed all dependencies, the following commands will be available.

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.  
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder using [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html).  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and produces an application bundle that is suitable to be served over a static hosting service.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner for unit tests on the application.  
For more details about testing check [jest](https://jestjs.io/pt-BR/) and [testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/)

### `yarn lint`

Execute eslint checking.

### `yarn prettier:fix`

Fix formatting issues on the project.

## Contributing

### Workspace

When developing new features, fixing a bug, adding tests, documentation or any other adition to this repository. First create a branch derived from `main` so that you can make your modifications, commit and then submit a pull request.

This project is already configured to enforce lint and code formatting with eslint and prettier.  
It is also integrated with husky so prior to any commit it will attempt to fix issues with lint, code formatting and will execute tests related to changes made.

If you're developing with `Visual Studio Code`, we recommend the following extensions:

- ESLint: Integrates ESLint JavaScript into VS Code.
- Prettier: Code formatter using prettier

### Pull Request

When creating a pull request, always mark the option to squash commits when merging into `main`, assing a main revisor for the request and perform a sanity check with another developer or QA agent.

The **main revisor** is reponsible to download the code, check functionality running in his environment and performing the code review adding comments and requests if required.

The **sanity check** (smoke test) is a quick, broad, and shallow testing with the goal to evaluate the result of a subset of functionalities to determine whether it is possible and reasonable to proceed with further testing and the review process. This process shouldn't be more than 5 minutes.

The **code analysis** will be execute with CI/CD where the lint check and tests will be executed.

After each process, a vote up üëç or vote down üëé is added to the merge request and after acquiring success on all ends, the pull request can be merged.
